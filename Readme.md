💡 Project Summary

This application, ReactMastery, is a comprehensive front-end project built using React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. It was developed to demonstrate mastery of modern component architecture, state management, and external API integration. The application features a fully functional Task Manager leveraging the useState and useMemo hooks, with task data persisted locally via a custom useLocalStorage hook. It also includes an API Integration page that fetches external data from JSONPlaceholder, implementing robust loading states, error handling, pagination, and a search feature. The entire application is styled responsively using Tailwind CSS utility classes and includes a global Light/Dark theme switcher powered by the React Context API.
